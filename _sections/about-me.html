<p>I am a software developer with a focus on Robotic Process Automation (RPA) using UiPath.
     Since 2019, I have been working in the field of software development, and for the past 
     three years, I have honed my skills in UiPath RPA. In 2020, I started pursuing a master's degree in Data Science, 
     and I am set to graduate in June. With my passion for technology and automation, I am excited to continue exploring 
     new frontiers in the world of data science and RPA.
